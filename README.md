CLI Control Scripts, no GUI


Aim
==========
The aim of this project is to create a set of very user friendly scripts (probably using ncurses) to provide a fully fledged Server Control Panel for a multi vhosts server with multi-tenant SSH & GIT access.


Target audience
==========
The target audience are people that work in website development and need a server to do what they tell it to do.
People that are tired of the limitations of the GUI and the shortcomings of some database-driven control panels.
